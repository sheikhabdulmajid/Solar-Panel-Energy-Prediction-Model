# Solar-Panel-Energy-Prediction-Model
Developed a predictive model that estimates the energy generated by a solalr panel given specific external factors

The output features, pivotal for the model's predictions, were encapsulated in a CSV file, while the input features were amalgamated in a JSON file. 

Recognizing the need for a cohesive dataset, the first imperative task was to meticulously pre-process the data.

The input features dataset was trained on Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

Random Forest model turned out be more accurate in terms of energy prediction, with an R-squared value of 0.9.

The input feature; Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), was found to have the highest correlation with the energy output.

Time Series Analysis of the energy output was also performed to determine the autocorrelation, which was found to be 0.96.
